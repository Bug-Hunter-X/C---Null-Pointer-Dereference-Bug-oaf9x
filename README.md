This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to assign a value to a memory address pointed to by a null pointer. This leads to undefined behavior, often resulting in a program crash. The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version, using proper null checks to prevent this error.  Always check for null pointers before dereferencing to prevent unexpected behavior and crashes.
